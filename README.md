# cursed limby

The goal of this project is to try to reach limit of ternary and recursive functions of the libmy (Epitech Small C Pool LibC).

If possible, this Lib C allows anyone who doesn't like Coding Style to do as they see fit.
It is still not recommended to use it for people who are not experienced in C, in ternary and recursive functions.

Task:

- [X] data_to_array_str
- [ ] get_len_array
- [ ] get_nbrlen
- [ ] my_abs
- [ ] my_calloc
- [ ] my_compute_power_rec
- [ ] my_compute_square_root
- [ ] my_convert_base
- [ ] my_find_prime_sup
- [ ] my_fputthat
- [ ] my_getnbr
- [ ] my_is_prime
- [ ] my_isneg
- [ ] my_max
- [ ] my_memset
- [ ] my_min
- [ ] my_printf
- [ ] my_put_nbr
- [ ] my_putchar
- [ ] my_putstr
- [ ] my_revstr
- [ ] my_showmem
- [ ] my_showstr
- [ ] my_sort_int_array
- [ ] my_str_isalpha
- [ ] my_str_isan
- [ ] my_str_islower
- [ ] my_str_isnum
- [ ] my_str_isprintable
- [ ] my_str_isupper
- [ ] my_str_without_char_array

We will move forward with our defeats and our victories to evolve into a perfect world.
Do unit tests.
